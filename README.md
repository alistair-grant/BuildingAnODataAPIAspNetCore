# Building an OData API in ASP.NET Core
Starter files and fully functioning finished sample code for [Kevin Dockx's](https://github.com/KevinDockx) "Building a Consistent RESTful API with OData v4 in ASP.NET Core" course over at Pluralsight.  

Code can be used on its own or together with the course, and comes in 2 flavours: one targets .NET 5, the other one targets .NET Core 3.1.  

Enjoy! :)
